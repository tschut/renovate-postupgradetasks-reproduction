# Reproduction for #32117

## Current behavior

The loaded config contains only the `postUpgradeTasks` defined in renovate.json

## Expected behavior

I suppose this is expected, but it would be nice if `postUpgradeTasks` could be an array, so you can extend from a preset and still define your own.
